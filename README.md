# Trends and inequalities in healthy working life expectancy in the United States

Christian Dudel, dudel@demogr.mpg.de 

## Summary

This repository contains code to estimate healthy working life expectancy and
related measures using data from the US Health and Retirement Study. The data
can be obtained from https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/ after a free registration. 
Specifically, this project uses the RAND-HRS file for the years 1992 to 2020, 
version 2. Replicating the analysis requires the package dtms, which is 
available here: https://github.com/christiandudel/dtms 

## Folders and files

Currently, on GitHub there are two folders: Code and Results. However, to run
the code requires adding a third folder called Data which contains the RAND-HRS
file. The folder Code contains two files. One file for data preparation and one file
which does most of the analysis; the latter also exports a few results which
are stored in the folder Results. Both code files come with extensive comments.
