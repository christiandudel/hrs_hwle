# Trends and inequalities in healthy working life expectancy in the United States

Christian Dudel, dudel@demogr.mpg.de 

This repository contains code to estimate healthy working life expectancy and
related measures using data from the US Health and Retirement Study. The data
can be obtained from https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/ after a free registration. 
Replicating the analysis requires the package dtms, which currently is not on CRAN
and available here: https://github.com/christiandudel/dtms
